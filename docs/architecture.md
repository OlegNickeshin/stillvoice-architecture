# StillVoice — System Architecture

This document describes the structural logic behind StillVoice without exposing operational code or sensitive infrastructure.

---

## Architectural Philosophy

StillVoice is not designed for behavioural optimisation or emotional engagement.
Its architecture prioritises:

- Ethical restraint
- Psychological safety
- Continuity without exploitation
- Silence as structural value

Every technical decision is filtered through one core question:

Does this increase domination — or preserve presence?

## High-Level System Overview

Client Interface (Browser)
        ↓
Session Layer (Stateless / Anonymous friendly)
        ↓
Dialogue Engine (LLM + Constraint Layer)
        ↓
Memory System (Soft Context Summaries)
        ↓
Response Filter (Ethical & Structural Constraints)

This flow ensures that:
- Identity is optional  
- Memory is contextual, not persistent ownership  
- Dialogue remains bounded and humane

---

## Key Structural Components

### 1. Interface Layer
- Minimal visual stimulation
- Deliberate spacing
- Input field designed to wait, not demand
- STOP control as ethical interrupt

---

### 2. Session & Identity Model
- Supports anonymous and persistent modes
- Anonymous = no storage, no identity binding
- Sessions prioritise continuity without ownership

---

### 3. Memory Layer
- Short-form summarisation
- No raw emotional archiving
- No behavioural profiling
- Memory ≠ surveillance

---

### 4. Scripture Integration
- Treated as parallel reality, not as command source
- Floating, contemplative layer
- Exists beside dialogue, not above it

---

## What this architecture avoids

- Infinite scrolling
- Dopamine loops
- User addiction mechanics
- Engagement manipulation
- Emotional dependency simulation

---

## Security Philosophy

StillVoice does not rely on obscurity.
It relies on:
- minimal exposure
- restrained design
- absence of exploitable emotional loops

---

## Closing note

StillVoice architecture is not built to dominate.
It is built to remain.

When systems grow louder, this one grows quieter.
